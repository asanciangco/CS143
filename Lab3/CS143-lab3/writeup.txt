Lab 3 Writeup

***NOTE: I used the provided solution for Lab 2 as a basis to begin lab 3***

Design Decisions
================
Selectivity estimation follows the methods described in the spec. The only
helper method made is used to calculate which bucket of the histogram the value
falls in.
Joins were implemented using nested loop joins and the join ordering was
implemented using the algorithm described in the spec (Selinger Algorithm).
No additional bonus exercises were implemented.

API Changes
===========
No changes were made to the project's API. 

Missing or Incomplete Elements of Code
======================================
All exercises and tasks were implemented fully. My project passes all tests and
system tests. Therefore, there are no missing or incomplete elements of code.

Time Spent on Lab
=================
I spent around 20 hours on this lab. The only difficult part of the lab was the
estimateSelectivity implementation. There seemed to be some freedom as to how
exactly to implement the calculations, and as such it was tricky to find an
implementation that was robust enough to pass all the tests yet simple enough to
quickly estimate the selectivity.
